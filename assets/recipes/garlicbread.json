I softened the butter in the microwave and mixed everything up in the same pyrex measuring cup.  I substituted dehydrated parsley, and let it rest in the butter for awhile before I spread it.  The garlic smelled very strong while cooking.  My wife is not a huge parmesan fan so I used about a tablespoon of grated.  It all came together beautifully.  There is no substitute for fresh garlic instead of powders and salts.  We only ate half of it for dinner.  We are going to put shredded mozzarella on the other half and put it under the broiler for a late night date night snack.  Enjoy!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-02-22","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"BlueDice"},"reviewBody":"Everyone loved this garlic bread.

I made it and my family loved it!!!  Nice and crispy and very tasty.  I replaced the salt with Adobo Seasoning and I also added onion powder and the dry chopped onion flakes.  Add a good amount of parmasan cheese!  I basically did the seasonings without the measurements, I just like to go my own way until I know it's a good amount for flavor.  Seasonings is key! :)","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-05-25","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"OliveGoggles"},"reviewBody":"5 stars.
